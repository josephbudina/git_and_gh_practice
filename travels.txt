So, I suppose I'll talk about the same trip with my camera for continuities sake.
I bought a round trip ticket to Paris for just over four hundred dollars and didn't make a plan about was I was going to do until I arrived.
This was fine because I ended up making my way to Budapest(and randomly stayed with some regular customers of the whole foods I worked at in denver that had moved a year prior), Berlin, and London.
It was great, and I can't wait to be able to travel again.
