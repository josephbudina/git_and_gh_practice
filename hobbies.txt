I bought a 51 year old 35mm camera on ebay a few years ago because I wanted to learn about photography, and I heard this was a great place to start.
It took me a while to pick it up, mostly due to some soldering work that I needed to do on it, but I was able to fix it shortly before a month long vacation.
I shot a bunch of photos without developing any of the film until long after the trip, and even though every photo that was taken was terrible; I fell in love with the process of film.
I had my first photography show shortly before the pandemic began!
